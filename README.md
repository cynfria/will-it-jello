# Will It Jello?

An interactive 3D web experience where you can click to jiggle realistic blue jello and embed objects inside it!

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Jello**: Click anywhere on the jello to make it jiggle with realistic physics
- **Spring-Mass Physics System**: Custom soft-body physics simulation for authentic jello behavior
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop images onto the page to embed objects inside the jello
- **WebGL Rendering**: Powered by Three.js for smooth 3D graphics
- **Realistic Materials**: Translucent jello material with proper lighting and shadows

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: WebGL 3D rendering library
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **Custom Physics**: Spring-mass system for jello simulation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## How to Use
